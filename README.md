This web application guides the user through the process of creating and validating alignments between different data sources.

The following features are available:

* It enables the user to manage different sets of data sources and alignments.
* It offers a graphical interface which enables the user to easily compare entities.
* It supports multiple data sources formats, such as Turtle, TriG, N-Triples, N-Quads, and Notation3 (N3).
* It allows the user to create ground truth alignments between entities that will be serialized in the EDOAL format.

Check out the [live demo](https://ehrhart-pfe.herokuapp.com/) of the web application.
